How do you become the very best Halo player you can be?

## Hit them where it hurts

Especially when you crank up the difficulty level and activate those sculls you will notice
that your ammo tends to run out when you need it the most. That's when you HAVE to up your game and begin
to not only rely on ammo, but also on brute force. I'm talking about hitting them in the back. Most enemies will
drop dead from this seemingly easy task. But it's harder than it looks, it's like a dance with the devil... one misstep
and you're probably toast. Few things are as satisfying as outwit the AI and hit them in the back and watch their lifeless
bodies fall to the ground.

## Use the plasma pistol

Often when I game it's a real struggle, that's until I remember that I have a [plasma pistol][plasma-pistol]. Just charge it properly, point it to an enemy and finish him/her (aliens) off with a headshot. Voila!

## Headshot the grunts

The grunts are always everywhere and can be a real pain if not handled properly. They are often times quite resilient to firepower
and you can easily find your self low on ammo if you don't watch yourself. Few things are as unthinkably embarrassing as being defeated by a [little grunt][halo-grunt], so take aim and headshot them. Boom! Mission accomplished.
