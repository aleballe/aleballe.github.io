# Hello!

Lately the possibilities of code in it many forms has started to intrigue me. For the moment
I'm studying at [Linnaeus University][linnaeus-university] of Sweden and learning great stuff for each passing day. It's really cool.

## Some of my passions

Life is nice, and there's some things i like really much.

### Cycling

Wasn't a big fan of the bicycle to begin with since I've always had junk bikes. But as faith would have it I randomly received a road bike from my uncle who had fallen from it and wanted nothing to do with it. Since then I've really enjoyed riding my bikes, even the crappy ones (strangely enough).

### Sauna and bath

A nice sauna and bath session, nothing beats it. Every Wednesday is sauna day at [Ribersborgs open-air swimming-bath][ribersbors-kallbadhus]. It's certainly humbling to take part in an activity where you walk around nude, makes you realize how alike we all are.

### Playing halo and drinking beer

The title really says it all, so fun.
